[{"content":"what am I even doing? My goal here is to just write new website entries for this site in Obsidian. I just stumbled upon this blog-post of networkchuck, a content creator that sparked my interest to be more into trying out \u0026ldquo;more technical stuff\u0026rdquo; on my own.\nThe problem here, at least for me, was that I already had started to build my website in a more complicated way before. I just uploaded the files manually to the GitHub repository manually. Painful and probably the reason I didn\u0026rsquo;t write stuff basically at all. But I was already building with hugo and using GitHub.\nwhat I am doing! building the file structure accordingly: So now I had to integrate the instructions into my own existing file structure etc. Turns out: not hard at all! I just had to: - build a corresponding file tree for the contents in Obsidian, -move the files from the folders in the /hugo/websitefolder folder to the one for Obsidian, - and perform rsync -av --delete \u0026quot;sourcepath\u0026quot; \u0026quot;destinationpath\u0026quot;, which will be automated at a later point.\nsetting up the image upload: In order to setup the pictures, I had to edit the python script of networkchuck to my file paths. But since I am using a different structure and have multiple directories, I had to come up with a solution: - duplicate the script - and set the path for each directory So now I have a script for each folder. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is the best solution, but for now it is working flawlessly!\nHere is a test picture: ! You can also check here, in the other category, to see that it indeed does work :)\ndoing the GitHub thing: As I have said earlier, pushing to git is something I haven\u0026rsquo;t done (in the right way) yet. So up to new territories then, I guess\u0026hellip;\nAfter I found out how to make my hugo folder my repository, thanks to YouTube and the GitHub documentation, it turned out to be pretty easy. And thanks to the script of networkchuck, which I edited very slightly, now everything worked with the push of a button!\nBUT then I had to figure out, how to build a hugo site from the whole hugo repository I just had put up to GitHub. My earlier approach was to just upload the \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; folder manually and set up the GitHub-pages from the root-folder. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t working anymore now. Thankfully there is a GitHub-action for that. And after yanking that code into my repository it was working perfectly! :)\nand now? Now I should have an easy way to publish new stuff on here. That\u0026rsquo;s awesome! If you want you can check out the repository on my GitHub and make fun of my files :D.\nNow I can set new goals and projects. The first ones? Probably to optimize the script and then the style.css . But for now I am happy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/read/integrating-obsidian/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-am-i-even-doing\"\u003ewhat am I even doing?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy goal here is to just write new website entries for this site in Obsidian.\nI just stumbled upon this \u003ca href=\"https://blog.networkchuck.com/posts/my-insane-blog-pipeline/\"\u003eblog-post of networkchuck\u003c/a\u003e, a content creator that sparked my interest to be more into trying out \u0026ldquo;more technical stuff\u0026rdquo; on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem here, at least for me, was that I already had started to build my website in a more complicated way before.

I just have the feeling recently, that the web is getting worse. Even more than I have thought it to be. But let me start from the beginning.\nThe internet, as I used to know it, has kind of ceased to exist. It used to be a place where actual humans used to interact. But recently I can\u0026rsquo;t overcome the feeling, that I - ironically - have lost the connection to actual real human people.\nMy first real experience of social media, after getting started with some long gone sites or facebook, was instagram. And I have enjoyed the engagement so much. Just sharing photographs I took with my first iPhone, interacting with other accounts that concentrated on photography was awesome. But eventually something changed. I can not recall exactly when or what has changed, it happened so slowly and gradually over the course of over a decade, that I just have accepted the changes. Was it reels, the rise of bots, influencers, whatnot? I donâ€™t know. And honestly I don\u0026rsquo;t give a fuck what exactly was the final nail to the coffin here. All I\u0026rsquo;m going to say is, that I hate it! Social media now just robs you of all your energy. Yeah we spam each other with memes and stuff, but do we really interact?\nEven forums that used to be so helpful, because of the interaction is filled now with useless shit. The flooding of AI content is one thing to consider. No need to elaborate this even further. But who the fuck decided to use auto AI translation on every damn thing, even audio in youtube videos?! Give me a break here, please.\nThe feeling I get from all this, is not just that I am pissed because of inconvenience: This is an upright \u0026ldquo;fuck u dear average internet user, we will take your autonomy now\u0026rdquo;. Now think about that fore a mere second please. What will this road lead us to? I am afraid that the consequence of this will even further strengthen the already fogginess of the post-factual era we already live in. That worries me. It makes me sad. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean, that I\u0026rsquo;m against the use of AI in general. Nothing could be further from the truth. But we have to see it as what these things are. They are (at this point) not intelligent, they do not produce anything new. These are tools which I want do decide over when and how to use and not be dictated by!\nAnd this feeling of being dictated, imposed on, stretches into fields I have never even imagined of. Let\u0026rsquo;s take gaming for example. Things like gaming chats or SBMM. Once you have been able to communicate with your opponents in game chats. Gone. You want to play a casual round of CoD? Nah bro, here is SBMM and now sweat. Now that kind of stuff makes me feel disconnected while having the fastest Internet connection I ever had (that\u0026rsquo;s actually a lie).\nI guess what I want to say here could be broken down into one single question everyone should think about: Whom should this amazing technology of connections serve? My answer? Humanity. What even this means\u0026hellip;\nblxt.\njan 08_2025\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/read/the_sick_man_of_today/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-wrong-with-the-internet\"\u003ewhat is wrong with the internet?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just have the feeling recently, that the web is getting worse.
